# Fall 2024 - COMP 206 - Homework 8: information security

Due: Thursday, 28 November 2024, 11:59pm.

This assignment consists of two parts.

1. Short-answer questions about encryption. You can expect similar types of questions on the
   upcoming midterm and final.
2. Two hacking challenges. I would ask theoretical questions about these topics on a test.

## Infosec theory and encryption (4 points)

Write your answers to these questions in a file `crypto.txt`

1. What are the three pillars of information security? Describe each in a sentence.
   - A hacker breaks into a hospital system and encrypts all patient records until receipt of
     payment. This is known as a _ransomware_ attack. What pillar of information security is
     undermined by this attack?
   - A hacker breaks into a payment processor's database, extracts all its information, and sells
     it to criminals. What pillar of information security is undermined by this attack?
3. Explain to what end and under what circumstances two parties would use the Diffie-Hellman key
   exchange algorithm.
4. Explain how the RSA algorithm can be used to prove ownership of a private key.
5. Assume that you and I have a preshared key K. Explain how you can use this key to attach an
   authentication code to a message that certifies to me that you authored the message *without
   encrypting the message.*

## Hacking Challenges

These challenges are inspired from
[Capture-the-Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) (CTF)
cybersecurity contests.

In these contests, organizers create purposefully vulnerable programs in which are hidden special
text strings called "flags". Contestants typically race to discover and exploit the vulnerabilities
in these programs to uncover the flags.

I have designed the two CTF-like challenges in this assignment not as a competition, so there is no
reward for completing them early. **I expect you to collaborate with one or two peers** in solving
these puzzles.

**Evaluation:**

Your solution to each challenge is evaluated the same way:
- 1pt for finding the flag.
- 4pts for a short writeup that explains _why_ what you did reveals the flag.
  Each challenge will include some guidance on what to include in your writeup.

**You must not hack these vulnerable programs beyond what is asked for in the assignment.**

**You must not "break" the challenges so that others can no longer complete them.**

### Challenge 1: injection attack

Visit [this web page](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~jerrin1/calc.html)

It is a simple calculator that evaluates integer arithmetic expressions in a stupidly unsafe
way.

In a file `injection.txt`, write a small journal entry that answers the following:
1. By what means are the expressions being evaluated by the server? How did you find that out?
2. What is the general shape of a malicious string that executes an arbitrary command of your
   choosing?
3. What is the flag?

### Challenge 2: reverse engineering / buffer overflow attack

Visit [this web page](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~jerrin1/login.html)
The username and password that you supply on this page are passed each as a separate line of
standard input to a (vulnerable) C program.

**Your objective is to break this login program,** logging in as the admin user without even
figuring out what the admin password is! Logging in as the admin user prints out the flag.

Typically in a reverse engineering challenge, one only gets the compiled binary file of the
vulnerable program. However, that would make this challenge exceedingly difficult for you, who has
probably not taken COMP 273 (yet!). That course introduces you to the inner workings of the CPU and
to assembly language programming.

However, to introduce you to binary reverse engineering in this assignment, I'm giving you
(redacted) source code of the vulnerable C program, giving you a quick intro to assembly language,
and giving you some explicit instructions that will invite you to compare the C source code with
its compiled, assembly-language version.

#### Small intro to assembly language

The primitive, intrinsic programming language of the CPU at the heart of a computer is called
_machine code._ Machine code is written in binary, so it is unreadable by humans without herculean
effort. A human-readable form of machine code exists, called _assembly language._ This is a textual
format in which each line of code directly corresponds to a machine code instruction.

Each different CPU architecture has its own machine code and hence its own assembly language. In
the rest of this description, I'll focus on the Intel x86_64 architecture and I'll write assembly
code in the so-called Intel syntax.

Each instruction in assembly language looks something like:

```
mnemonic op1, op2
```

- The "mnemonic" identifies what kind of operation the CPU should perform.
  This can be operations like "add numbers", "jump execution to a different location", or "check if
  two numbers are equal".
- `op1` `op2` are the operands of the operation.
  Depending on the operation, the operands can be literal integer values (called _immediate
  values_), memory addresses from which data should be read or written, or internal CPU variables
  called _registers._
  Different operations can vary in how many operands they use; they do not all use 2 operands.

A few example operations you'll see:
* `sub rsp, 0x40` subtracts the literal value `0x40` from the value in the register `rsp`.
* `mov dword ptr [rbp-4], 0` moves (copies) the literal value 0 to the memory address `rbp-4`.
  * Square brackets indicate a memory address. So `0` is the literal 0, but `[0]` is the memory
    address 0.
  * The `dword ptr` part is called a _size modifier_ and specifies that `rbp-4` should be understood
    as a "double-word pointer". A "word" in Intel assembly means 16 bits, so a double-word is 32
    bits.

**Aside: hexadecimal notation**

- When numbers are written with the prefix `0x`, this indicates that they are written in
  _heXadecimal_ notation -- that's base 16.
- The digits A thru F represent numbers 10 thru 15 respectively. So `0xA` is how we write `10` in
  hex.
- Hexadecimal notation is convenient because with exactly two digits we can represent all possible
  values of a single byte: `0x00` is zero and `0xFF` is 255.
- You should know from a math class how to convert between different number bases by hand, but you
  can use bash to quickly convert from hex to base10 simply with `echo $((0x4A2))`. This outputs
  `1186`, = `4 x 16^2 + 10 x 16^1 + 2 x 16^0`, = `1024 + 160 + 2`.

A x86_64 CPU has many registers; see [here](https://math.hws.edu/eck/cs220/f22/registers.html) for
a table summarizing the basic ones.

**Of particular importance** are the `rbp` and `rsp` registers. These are called the _base pointer_
and _stack pointer,_ respectively. The `rbp` holds the address of the top of the current stack
frame, whereas `rsp` holds the address fo the bottom of the current stack frame.

Remember how local variables go on the stack C?
At the beginning of a function in assembly, we usually see `sub rsp, 0xHH` -- this is how `0xHH`
bytes of space is allocated on the stack, to hold the values of all the local variables of our
function. (Recall from [the video you watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S0aBV-Waeo) that
the stack grows downwards.) Then, local variables are referred to in the assembly code by an offset
from the base pointer `rbp`. For example, if a function has only two local variables `int a, b;`
then the address of `a` is `rbp-4` and `b`'s is `rbp-8`.

#### Your instructions

In a file called `re.txt`, write another small journal entry about how you broke the `vulnerable`
program. Follow the below procedure to do so, and be sure to write answers for the parts in
**boldface.**

0. Read the source code `vulnerable.c`. **Which part of the program is unsafe? Why?**
1. Run `make` to compile the vulnerable program.
2. Run `gdb ./vulnerable` to load the program in the GNU debugger (gdb).
3. The debugger is an interactive command-line program.
    - If you get a prompt "Enable debuginfod for this session" just say no.
    - Run `set disassembly-flavor intel` to use Intel syntax for assembly code.
    - Run `disassemble main` to show the assembly code for the `main` function.
4. Compare the assembly code for `main` with the source code.
    - **Which instructions correspond to initializing the variables `admin` and `login_successful`
      with zero?**
    - **Why is there no instruction that initializes `buf`?**
    - The `call` instruction is used to call the function at the specified address.
      GDB shows in angle-brackets the name of the function at that address.
    - **What value is passed as input to the `read_stdin_line` function?** Express your answer as
      an offset of `rbp`. (Refer back [here](https://math.hws.edu/eck/cs220/f22/registers.html) to
      see what registers are used to pass arguments to functions.)
5. **Make a small textual diagram of the RAM in this function, indicating which ranges of bytes (as
   offsets of `rbp`) store the values of the `admin`, `login_successful`, and `buf`.**
6. Quit gdb.
7. Run `./vulnerable`. Following your above investigation, find an input string triggering a buffer
   overflow to print `FLAG: REDACTED`.
   **Explain why your chosen string prints the flag. Refer to your diagram in your explanation.**
8. Use your string in the web site to get the real flag. **What is the flag?**
9. **Describe a small change one could make to `vulnerable.c`, without addressing the buffer
   overflow vulnerability, that would defeat the approach you used.**

#### Small bonus (no marks)

Can you find a simple way to use the injection attack from the previous part to uncover the flag
for the reverse engineering part? (Hint: look up the `strings` program.)

## Submission instructions

The text files `crypto.txt`, `injection.txt`, and `re.txt` must be in
`~/fall2024-comp206/assignments/hw8` by the due date.
